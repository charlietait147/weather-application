# Business Benefits of the Backend Services

<h2>The problems that the backend service will solve </h2>

<h3>1. User Authentication</h3>

- <strong>Problem:</strong> Ensure the securing of user registration, login and user passwords.

- <strong>Solution:</strong> A backend service can handle this user registration, a login authentication service, and any changes to a user password which in turn can ensure data security. 

<h3>2. Management of Favourite Locations</h3>

- <strong>Problem:</strong> Storing and managing a user's favourite location in an efficient manner.

- <strong>Solution:</strong> A backend service can provide endpoint routes which can add, fetch or delete favourite locations for authenticated users which can make the user experience much more seamless.

<h3>3. Implementation of JWT Authentication</h3>

- <strong>Problem:</strong> A simple check of a username and password is not a secure standardised authentication method.

- <strong>Solution:</strong> Implementing JSON Web Token Authentication ensures a standardised approach for user authentication.
