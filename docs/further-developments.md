# Further Development Suggestions For Travel Information Application

<h2>Integration with Further Mapping API's</h2>

Benefits:

- <strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong> Integrating with other Map API's such as Google Maps or Mapbox provide users with interactive, user-friendly maps which displays a user's searched location and any surrounding areas. The user can visually explore any nearby places or landmarks they want to visit.

- <strong>Route planning:</strong> Users are able to plan travelling routes, estimate travel times between specified locations.

Implementation:

- Use map components in DFCorp travel info application to display a location.

- Use mapping API's to fetch data and display it.

Potential Risks:

- <strong>Privacy Concerns: </strong> With the use of location data, this may need to be handled with consideration to ensure that DFCorp comply with privacy and regulations requirements like GDPR.

- <strong>Cost:</strong> Mapping API's can have usage-based pricing, which can have a surge in unexpected costs if the usage of this API increases rapidly.



<h2> Integration with Further Hotel Booking API's</h2>

Benefits: 

- <strong>Direct booking with Hotels:</strong> Using hotel API's like Booking.com or Expedia allow users to directly book from DFCorp, whilst providing a seamless experience.

- <strong>Real-time availability:</strong> DFCorp will have the ability to showcase real-time availability, current rates and descriptions of hotels.

Implementation:

- Display a list of hotels in the searched location of the user. Add relevant details to the hotel.

- Implement potential filters for price ranges or stars or other services.

Risks:

- <strong>Accuracy of data:</strong> DFCorp will need to ensure that the hotel APIs is up to its current date to avoid any user unsatisfaction.

- <strong>Security in transactions:</strong> DFCorp will have to handle any user payment details if the direct booking functionality is implemented.


<h2>Integration with Transportation API's</h2>

Benefits: 

- <strong>Planning travel routes:</strong> Transportation API's like Google Maps Direction API can provider users with information on public transportation options, schedules and routes a user can take.

- <strong>Airport information:</strong> Users are able to find out their flight status, flight delays and terminal details for their flight.

Implementation:

- Display estimated travel times, and booking links for tickets.

Risks:

- <strong>Complexity:</strong> Adding travel features to the application's interface will add a layer of complexity and require more time to complete.

- <strong>Data Accuracy:</strong> This is only dependent on a third-party for real-time data accuracy, so if there is a data outage, this cannot be controlled.
